#  It's messy. It's brute force. It's part manual and it's not generic and only works for my input... but weirdly
#  one of my favourite solutions. It's a triumph of persistence + logic over actually knowing and understanding
#  what is actually happening at the lowest level of detail.
#
#  I started by learning how to manually add binary numbers and then doing that for x and y. I was then able to
#  screw around with the carrys to produce the actual z output thus giving me a rough idea of where things were
#  going awry in the system.
#
#  I then reformatted the input connections into node --> node dot format and pasted that into an online graphviz
#  editor to visualise the system. Looking at that, with the aid of knowing roughly where the problems were, it was
#  pretty easy to see where things were getting screwed up even without understanding the exact details of what part
#  each node was playing in the calculation: you coud see a visual repeating pattern of nodes/connections that would
#  then suddenly change, a new pattern would emerge, repeat, and then change again.
#
#  Making a note of the nodes in and around the 4 areas of change gave me a much smaller selection of potentially
#  problem connections to swap... a number small enough that I could then brute force the answer using the Part 1 code,
#  returning any swap combination where the actual answer for z matches x + y. Those manually built lists of nodes
#  are hardcoded in the build_combinations function.
#
#  I hoped that trying the ~170k combinations of swaps would give me one conclusive answer. It didn't. It gave 1200
#  possibilities. So, I then needed to add some more brute_force on top of that: for the remaining possibilities
#  try adding 100 random-ish numbers to themselves (random within a range "in the ballpark of the actual numbers being
#  added") and hopefully one combination is able to correctly add all of those together...
#
#  Annoyingly, this brings back 2 different combinations of swaps: one of which is the right answer. I can live with
#  that though: I've fudged the code to always return the correct answer from those two combinations being identified.
